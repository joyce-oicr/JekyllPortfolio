__Problem Definition:__ The gap between rudimentary and advanced STEM courses has been widened due to virtual learning, causing students to struggle greatly. Concepts in physics and chemistry, such as fluid dynamics, are often neglected but reemerge in university. In addition, students often have trouble applying their previous knowledge to courses that require the practical application of these broad topics. This learning kit resolves discrepancies in student comprehension of physics, chemistry, and engineering design by offering an interactive experience in the classroom or at home. It lifts small objects while demonstrating the gas laws, volumetric flow rate, along with dynamics and pressure relationships.
