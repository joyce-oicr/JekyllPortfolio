desc_txt: "The creation of my cell phone stand allowed me to struggle through the process of transforming my sketches into a 3D model for print. I first designed the stand on paper, then used SolidWorks to actualize my sketch before printing. The issues encountered along the way, such as determining the dimensions for each part to fit into one another, adjusting characteristics while modelling, and determining the best way to showcase the final product to an audience, was able to bridge the gap between the skills I learnt about engineering design to its application in real projects. This process taught me how to problem-solve and think laterally on Solid Works in order to achieve my vision while staying within the constraints and optimizing the criteria."
